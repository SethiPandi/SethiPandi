## About Me
I'm inspired by the idea of working collaboratively to push open
technology forward. I want to live in a world where there is software for
everything, freely accessible to everyone.

Everything I do is contributed to open-source projects; ideally free from cost,
tracking, and advertising. I primarily develop and maintain software, and love
contributing to projects that I find interesting or depend on.

## Career
My ideals and values align well with software development, so I incorporated
[Elypia][elypia-website], a [Community Interest Company (CIC)][wikipedia-cic]
that's looking to: 

* Develop software to lower the level of entry into particular industries.
* Create open-source software for industries with only proprietary, or legacy
  options available.
* Promote education by providing a bridge to enterprise tools and libraries
  with smaller use-cases.
